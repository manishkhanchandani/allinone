Server Behavior is showing Insert Record in the box

Dreamweaver creates hidden input field, MM_insert

Now when page loads, it will show the form, user will fill the form and when user submits the form, the data is sent to the server,

PHP server,

when form is submitted, it goes  to the server either as POST or as GET


GET method, when form is submitted, it will show in url as following:

http://blah.com/?keyword=chess&title=my+title

$_GET['kw']

$_GET['title']

Post will send the data to the server in hidden part of browser.




Create a new page
we added recordset, conn, choose table, rest default settings
insert -> dynamic data -> dynamic table
insert -> record set paging -> recordset navigation bar
insert -> display record count

created text -> show region -> show if recordset is empty

and i selected all above 3 sections and show if recordset is not empty.
