Server Behavior is showing Insert Record in the box

Dreamweaver creates hidden input field, MM_insert

Now when page loads, it will show the form, user will fill the form and when user submits the form, the data is sent to the server,

PHP server,

when form is submitted, it goes  to the server either as POST or as GET




css
http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/transitions/




GET method, when form is submitted, it will show in url as following:

http://blah.com/?keyword=chess&title=my+title

$_GET['kw']

$_GET['title']

Post will send the data to the server in hidden part of browser.




Create a new page
we added recordset, conn, choose table, rest default settings
insert -> dynamic data -> dynamic table
insert -> record set paging -> recordset navigation bar
insert -> display record count

created text -> show region -> show if recordset is empty

and i selected all above 3 sections and show if recordset is not empty.

i++ is called increment operator
i-- is called decrement operator

var i = 0;
i++; (i = i + 1;)

Life Reminder

Phase 1, Simple

User will come in this website, he will register and login to this website,

My Settings
	every month he login on our website once, and if he don't login for 1 month
	that means i will consider him dead,
	and then i will send email to him and i will ask "Are you alive", if yes - reply below, and if not, don't worry "we will send your message to related email" and if don't reply in 72 hours, then i will send my message to his relative.
	
	kate has logged on our website on may 22 2017
	
	Cron will run for users and it will check,
	
	Kate
		send email to kate
		emailFlag1 = 1
		emailFlagDate = currentTime()
		
	Kate will receive the email and she will click yes and she logs in our site
		login_dt = current date
		emailFlag1 = 0
		
	I have to wait for 3 days for her to reply, cron will be worried,
	
	Cron has to take action	
		
		Cron will go to reminders and cron will find all the reminders of kate and cron will check if all reminders in active state and then cron will email all the reminders to related emails.

Steps
1. Create repository on github
2. Git clone to get the repository on our local folder
3. Create a site in dreamweaver
4. Create a database and related tables
5. Create Pages

Phase 1, limited functionality

Entry page: index.php, contact_us.php, faq.php, our_team.php, about_us.php, terms.php, privacy.php

users
	Login: login.php, intermediate1.php, login_success.php, login_failure.php, 
	Register: register.php, register_success.php, register_failure.php, intermediate2.php (mail to user)
	Forgot: forgot.php, forgot_success.php, forgot_failure.php, intermediate3.php (mail to user with his password)
	Change Password: change_password.php
	logout.php

reminder
	new_reminder.php
	list_reminders.php
	edit_reminder.php
	delete_reminder.php

cron
	cron1.php	it will check if user is not logged in for 1 month, if user has not logged in then send mail and update the database
	cron2.php	it will check if user is not appeared within 3 days and if so, it will send reminders to all loved ones.


6. Create Template
7. Add navigation to the template



He will create reminder's
	Email: son's email address
	Message: million dollar is kept for you in bank, bank locker number blah blah
	
When this person die, this message will be send to the email.

some message to his son, but now, after his death, 




4 types of position
static
relative
absolute
fixed


top, left, bottom, right



relative position:
	top or left or bottom or right, was calculated from the position where div was present originally

abolute position:
	top or left or bottom or right, from the parent (body)
	
static position
static is default position
relative is change of position from its original position
absolute is change of position from the document or body
fixed is similar to absolute but it remains at fixed position where as absolute changes position on scrolling.

to make the div center align, use static or relative position with margin: auto.




Relative Position or static position
	margin: auto;
	margin: 0 auto;
	
Absolute Position
	margin: auto will not work
	
	left: 50%
	margin-left: -half of the div width
	
	top: 50%
	margin-top: -half of the div height

Position: relative
	top or bottom does not have %
	
	
ES 5 version

ES 6 Version


Constants are defined only once and we cannot change the value once it is assigned;
const PI = 3.14;
console.log(PI);

var age = 30;
if (age == 30) {
	let firstName = 'manny';
	console.log('first name is ', firstName);
}
console.log('first name is ', firstName);


CSS
Create 2 div, one is parent and one is child
make parent div as either position = relative or position = absolute and you can rearrange the top div as per your requirement using following properties: top = 0, left = 0, bottom = 0, right = 0, left=50% and margin-left as needed, top=50% and margin-top as needed.

child div should always be absolute, then child div will be attached to parent div.


Javascript

var book = {
	name: 'Learning Javascript'

console.log(book.name);
console.log('hello

Normal
	rsEdit
	Insert -> Application Object -> Update -> Update Record Form Wizard and we choose only login_dt
	
We changed
	$updateSQL = sprintf("UPDATE lr_users SET login_dt=%s WHERE user_id=%s",
				   GetSQLValueString(time(), "int"),
				   GetSQLValueString($row_rsEdit['user_id'], "int"));
				   
We moved following part above update statement

$colname_rsEdit = "-1";
if (isset($_SESSION['MM_Username'])) {
  $colname_rsEdit = (get_magic_quotes_gpc()) ? $_SESSION['MM_Username'] : addslashes($_SESSION['MM_Username']);
}
mysql_select_db($database_conn, $conn);
$query_rsEdit = sprintf("SELECT * FROM lr_users WHERE email = '%s'", $colname_rsEdit);
$rsEdit = mysql_query($query_rsEdit, $conn) or die(mysql_error());
$row_rsEdit = mysql_fetch_assoc($rsEdit);
$totalRows_rsEdit = mysql_num_rows($rsEdit);

Then we put header location to redirect to user to success.php page

header("Location: login_success.php");
exit;

Cron2 Logic

1. Get all users who have not logged in for 3 days, and whose emailFlag1 = 1, and cronFlag = 0
2. loop through the users which we got from step 1
3. While Loop
4. 		Get all reminders for each user
5.		While Loop for reminders
6.		Construct a message and send email to that reminder's email
5a.		While Loop ends
7. Update the user with cronFlag = 1
3a. While Loop Ends

Step 1: Dreamweaver drag and drop
Step 2: We will go through each file and see what code is generated by dreamweaver, 20 types of pages we did
Step 3: We will put all the code in function and instead of dreamweaver code, we will the function.
Step 4: We will create php classes and functions inside the classes and put all the code inside it.

var sayHello = function() {
	console.log('hello ' + this.name);
}

var sayGoodBye = function() {
	console.log('Goodbye ' + this.name);
}

sayHello();
sayGoodBye();

	
sayHello.call(person1);
sayHello.call(person2);
sayHello.call(person3);
	
sayGoodBye.apply(person1);
sayGoodBye.apply(person2);
sayGoodBye.apply(person3);

	
//function 1
var say = function(greeting) {
	console.log(greeting + ' ' + this.name);
}

	
//function 2
var update = function(name, age, size) {
	console.log('name is ', this.name);
}

//call
say.call(person1, 'Hello');
update.call(person1, 'Mango', 23, 'Large');

//apply
say.apply(person1, ['Hello']);
update.apply(person1, ['Mango', 23, 'Large']);
		
		
Both can be called on functions, which they run in the context of the first argument (person1)
In call, the subsequent arguments are passed in to the function as they are,
while apply expects the second argument to be an array.

CSS
Transition, if you go from one css to another css property in slow motion, animation. 


transition-property: width; // width or height or any other property
transition-duration: 2s; //width: 100 -> 500, 
transition-timing-function: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out

ease: starts slow, then goes fast and then end slow
linear: same speed
ease-in: slow start, then fast
ease-out: start fast, end slow
ease-in-out: start slow and end slow, 

transition-delay: 1s; //transition effect will start after 1 sec



To add number or value in array, use push
numbers.push(33);

to add value in beginning of an array, use unshift
numbers.unshift(25);

to remove element from end of array we use pop, 
var myValue = numbers.pop();

and here myValue will contain that removed item.

to remove item from the beginnig of the array, use shift()
numbers.shift();

REACT JS

UI component, It is used to build user interfaces 

Link React app to the PHP backend

JSX
.jsx
.js

Components

We create lot of components


MVC framework, 
Model, View, Controller, 

React - View part of MVC framework
+
Redux is framework on top of react,


Angualar is bidirectional 

React is unidirectional

Component
	variable
	
	show it on view
	
	Inside the javascript - Virtual Dom
	<div>, but it is virtual div tag

	<div and then manipulate it
	
	you create div with manipulation, 
	
	
	
	
Whenever we want to view something from the database,
We create a Recordset

Dynamic Table
Pagination



Build whole website which is in php, in api -> outputs all the data in json format


Soft Delete
	flag = 0, otherwise flag = 1

Hard Delete
	deleting from the database, it is called hard delete








A. STATE
B. PROP






Opinion Page

create_views.php

Functionalities

1. Restrict access to the site
2. All get the record for the religion with religion_id
	checking for the page
	
	a. if this record has status of approved
	b. if status is deleted (2), then don't show view page or religion page to owner and anyone on the site.
	c. , and if it not approved then i will check if logged in user is owner of this religion

	c. if it is public, allow any one to add
	d. if it is closed, allow only owner of religion to add the record


	Steps
		Before I insert it
		
		I have list of all bad words,
		
		I go through the text which is submitted by the user, regexp, php can recognize the all the bad words, and delete those words and then subtmit the result to the database.





A. Insert new opinion / views


views.php
B. All the list of Views

Religion
0 = Pending
1 = approved
2 = blocked
3 = deleted

Views

0 - not approved
1 - approved
2 - blocked
3 - deleted





















State
	create a variable in the state, and you can update the variable in the state, 
	
Props
	cannot create the variable,
	you only get variables from somewhere
	only for showing the data, no update allowed, no insert allowed, only carry data from one place to another for showing purpose.




	create variable (state)
		constructor (props)
			super(props)
			
			
			functions inside component to update the state
			
			
			once state is updated, render function is called again
			
			this.setState({username: 'new value'});
			
	When we change the state, then render is called again

Religious Belief's
Faith – It does not make things easy, it makes them possible.
Free Trip to heaven. Details Inside.
God can hear you.
God has a great plan for your life.
God is stronger than my circumstances.
I believe in God. Never panic, just pray.
If God is for us, Who can be against us?

Know God, Know Peace; No God, No Peace.
People are like tea bags — you have to put them in hot water before you know how strong they are.
